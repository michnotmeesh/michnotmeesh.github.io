After your first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, what are your impressions? 
Are you finding that getting the green checkmark is painful, or useful, or both, or something else entirely?


I kind of like the code validators because:
1. I can read other people's code easily
2. Other people can read my code easily

It is important to have readable and well-structed code! 
By using ESlint, I learned really quickly how all of these errors are simply practice for achieving readable and well-structured code.

I like how it also made it easier to search and debug all errors visually.
In other ICS classes, it would literally take hours and hours and hours to find a missing semi colon or curly bracket. The errors even check for spelling within comments!
Not all of the error messages are specific, but they are pretty decent and they take you to the exact line of where the error is. I like that a lot!

When I code, I try my best to ignore the ESlint errors and focus on getting the functions and program to run.
Since I don't have much practice, coding standards are not my priority. But as I code more and more using the code validators, I become more accustomed to the coding standard. And I receive less and less errors, which is good!

When I'm done correcting all fo the ESlint errors, I take a look at my code and think "you're right! This looks so much better!"

Shortcuts are amazing! We should just get rid of the mouse. The shortcuts make everything easier and it really affirms how annoying it is to click things.

Git is also awesome! It's basically the ultimate redo button. I like how we can go into individuals commits to see changes. We can also go back to specific commits and get back my work. It reminded me of google doc hisory log and how you're able to revert old changes.

Git is extremely powerful. I was thinking about how all of our assignments can basically be done through Git and graded through Git. Aka we could get rid of Laulima altogether.
Like the instructor could make a repository for each assignment and students would have to clone the repository then work on it locally (similar to the techfolio). Even security is covered through GitHub because repositories can be made private and we can simply make the TA a collaborator. I haven't fully explored GitHub, yet. But the final peice would be grading. If there's a way to get line-for-line grading comments through GitHub we could make the need for Laulima obsolete.

I'm thinking back to our former ICS courses when coding standard weren't enforced...no wonder our TAs took forever to grade them! They probably spent hours just trying to read it alone!
