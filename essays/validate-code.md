This is my formal apology to all previous ICS TAs for having to read my code before I learned about coding standards and code validating tools (No wonder it always took _forever_ to grade our homework). After this module, my biggest takeaway was realizing how following coding standards does so much more than change the format of your code.

## As a Learner

I felt quite intimidated the first time setting up IntelliJ, ESLint, and GitHub. There were many instructions and I ran into many issues with the set up alone. However, beginning is the first step and these tools make coding a whole easier.

### ESLint

ESLint helped my code become more readable and well-structured, but there was definitely a learning curve. It was a bit frustrating to suddenly have so many warning and red underlines appear. It was especially annoying when the errors were for the tiniest mistakes, like trailing spaces or missing spaces. Like, will the program not run if I don't fix those errors? It shouldn't be a big deal.

However, receiving those errors and taking the time to fix them was very helpful because it taught me what not to do next time.  As I practiced more and more with ESLint running, less and less errors appeared and doing it the new way started to grow on me. That's the beauty of making mistakes: you learn something from them and become better.

When I code now, I have two priorities. The first priority is to focus on writing each function and getting the program to run as expected. I ignore all of the ESLint errors because most of them are quick fixes for readability purposes. When the program runs like I want it to, then I move onto the next priority: making the code readable. This is when I focus on the ESLint errors. When I'm done correcting all fo the errors, I take a look at my code and think "This looks so much better!"

ESLint makes it easier to search and debug any code. In other ICS classes, it would literally take hours and hours and hours to find a missing semi colon or curly bracket because it was just so messy and illegible. Although not every ESLint error message is specific or helpful, it is definiely an upgrade from what we had to do before in order to fix errors.

## GitHub and git

Git is extremely powerful. I was thinking about how all of our assignments can basically be done through Git and graded through Git. Aka we could get rid of Laulima altogether.
Like the instructor could make a repository for each assignment and students would have to clone the repository then work on it locally (similar to the techfolio). Even security is covered through GitHub because repositories can be made private and we can simply make the TA a collaborator. I haven't fully explored GitHub, yet. But the final peice would be grading. If there's a way to get line-for-line grading comments through GitHub we could make the need for Laulima obsolete.

## As a Developer

Shortcuts are amazing! We should just get rid of the mouse. The shortcuts make everything easier and it really affirms how annoying it is to click things.

Git is also awesome! It's basically the ultimate redo button. I like how we can go into individuals commits to see changes. We can also go back to specific commits and get back my work. It reminded me of google doc hisory log and how you're able to revert old changes.


## Looking Forward
Growth is realizing that your code is no longer just for your own reference. Utilizing coding standards introduced a crucial part of software engineering: teamwork. Although we have not started any group work, yet, this week provided resources and standards for how group work can be done effectively.

Growth is validating your code and liking it. If you have the time, shoot your former TAs an email thanking them for even attempting to read your mess of code.

I kind of like the code validators because:
1. I can read other people's code easily
2. Other people can read my code easily
