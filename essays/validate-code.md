This is my formal apology to all previous ICS TAs for having to read my code before I learned about coding standards and code validating tools (No wonder it always took _forever_ to grade our homework). After this module, my biggest takeaway was realizing how following coding standards does so much more than change the format of your code.

## As a Learner

I felt quite intimidated the first time setting up IntelliJ, ESLint, and GitHub. There were many instructions and I ran into many issues with the set up alone. However, beginning is the first step and these tools make coding a whole easier.

### ESLint

ESLint helped my code become more readable and well-structured, but there was definitely a learning curve. It was a bit frustrating to suddenly have so many warning and red underlines appear. It was especially annoying when the errors were for the tiniest mistakes, like trailing spaces or missing spaces. Like, will the program not run if I don't fix those errors? It shouldn't be a big deal.

However, receiving those errors and taking the time to fix them was very helpful because it taught me what not to do next time.  As I practiced more and more with ESLint running, less and less errors appeared and doing it the new way started to grow on me. That's the beauty of making mistakes: you learn something from them and become better.

When I code now, I have two priorities. The first priority is to focus on writing each function and getting the program to run as expected. I ignore all of the ESLint errors because most of them are quick fixes for readability purposes. When the program runs like I want it to, then I move onto the next priority: making the code readable. This is when I focus on the ESLint errors. When I'm done correcting all fo the errors, I take a look at my code and think "This looks so much better!"

ESLint makes it easier to search and debug any code. In other ICS classes, it would literally take hours and hours and hours to find a missing semi colon or curly bracket because it was just so messy and illegible. Although not every ESLint error message is specific or helpful, it is definiely an upgrade from what we had to do before in order to fix errors.

### GitHub and git

Git is basically the ultimate redo button and GitHub is the log that keeps all the old changes. I haven't used the individual commits, fetch, or branches in any practical ways just yet, but I can see how useful it would be when working on a bigeer project with multiple developers. I also really appreciate how each committ distinguishes changes; green for additions, yellow for modifications, and red for deletion. Each committ even logs who made the changes. GitHub and git make group work very simple.

## As a Developer

GitHub and git is extremely powerful, its inspiring. While exploring GitHub, I was thinking about how all of our assignments can basically be done through GitHub and graded using git. In other words, I was really trying to find a way to get rid of Laulima (because it really does suck).

Here is my _general_ idea for using git to conduct assignments would work:
1. Instructor create a private repository for the assignment, which includes instructions, expectations, and possibly starter code
2. Students get invited and clone the repository onto their local computer. When working on the assignment, students are allowed to make as many committs as they need.
3. To turn in the assignment, students push their repository onto another repository specifically for turning in assignments
4. When it is past the due date, the instructor makes the repository private and no submissions are accepted

This is not a complete idea, but I strongly believe that something like GitHub can be modified to support distributing and collecting assignments in a secure and easy way. If there is a way to make the need for Laulima obsolete, I'm all for it.

## Looking Forward
Growth is realizing that your code is no longer just for your own reference. Utilizing coding standards introduced a crucial part of software engineering: teamwork. Although we have not started any group work, yet, this week provided resources and standards for how group work can be done effectively.


_If you have the time, shoot your former TAs an email thanking them for even attempting to read your mess of code._
