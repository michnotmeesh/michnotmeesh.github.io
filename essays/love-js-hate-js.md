*Loving JavaScript, Hating JavaScript: Learning to like coding again*

Programming for the first time is not an easy task. Like any new adventure, there will be difficulties, triumphs, and growth.

## Expectations as a High Schooler

The very first programming course at my high school was offered my senior year and I signed up becuase who isn't attracted to new things? Plus, it was my last year and I was desperate to figure out my ***passion*** in the next 9 months.

The course was title ****Introduction to Web Develolpment***, and I knew it was going to be a worthwhile course because it filled up with students from various pathways (think of pathways as majors are in college).

Learning how to build your own website was not a skill isolated only to students interested in computer science.

For the entire year, I looked forward to going to that class after every lunch period becuase I made friends who had so many different interests that I never expected to learn about in a programming course.

The content was extremely difficult to understand, but I was not alone. No one in that class had prior experience with coding and that motivated many students to pursue learning and practicing outside of the class time. I learned what Stack Exchange was and my classmates and I used it every day find example code.

This introductory course was the main reason why I chose to study Computer Science in college.

## Java isn't JavaScript?

It is not. I wish someone had told me the difference before I started college.

Every introductory college course taught only in Java and those courses were the pre-reqs to all other programming courses.

As I was learning Java and discovering that Computer Science is beyond creative-personal interest, I developed some resentment toward JavaScript and my web development teachers for not preparing me well enough. It didn't help when I learned that many students viewed Java as the "standard" for first-time programmers. So many students already knew Java and I felt myself being left behind because I didn't follow the "standard" path into computer science. I had a hard time learning the language and an even harder time finding ways to enjoy coding in Java.

Not being prepared (or at least what I thought was "unprepared" at the time) for the introductory course deteriorated my sights for a career in computer science because if I wasn't good at it now, then I'd never be good at it later.

However, the problem didn't lie in my lack of knowledge or preparation. It was my fear of change and inability to understand that these moments of doubts are all part of the experience that comes with life transitions and new beginnings.

College is rough, but it's okay.

## Learning to like coding...again

There's something comforting about facing your fears and creating new joy in 
Revisting old code and cringing

Joining ICSpark

ICS 314

All of these things make me excited to code again. 

College is supposed to be hard because it makes you realize what is worth your time

I have experience with learning web development the first week in has been very fulfilling!
