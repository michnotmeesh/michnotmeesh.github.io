*Loving JavaScript, Hating JavaScript: Relearning to like coding again*

Programming for the first time is not an easy task. Like any new adventure, there will be difficulties, triumphs, and growth.

This is my journey with coding and how JavaScript is the full circle moment I needed to continue studying computer science.

## Expectations as a High Schooler

The very first programming course at my high school was offered my junior year and I signed up becuase who isn't attracted to new things?

The course was title ****Introduction to Web Develolpment***, and I knew it was going to be a worthwhile course because it filled up with students from various pathways (think of pathways as majors are in college).

Learning how to build your own website was not a skill isolated only to students interested in computer science.

For the entire year, I looked forward to going to that class after every lunch period becuase I made friends who had so many different interests that I never expected to learn about in a programming course.

The content was extremely difficult to understand, but I was not alone. No one in that class had prior experience with coding and that fostered many students going beyond to learn more.

## Java isn't JavaScript?

College basically taught everything in java.

I hated learning javascript first because I realized how many shortcuts the language had

I learned that many students started on java and had already known so much.

We got rid of creaitve browsers and design and replaced them with effeciency and theory

why do colleges expect us to already know everythng before taking the class we are suppsoed to learn in?

I became very discouraged the first year of college becuase of the sudden change and my mind couldn't relate the two languages together.

The problem didn't lie in the language, rather it was my fear of change and inability to understand that everyone questions their passions in college.

College is rough.

## The Only Option is to Move Forward

Revisting old code and cringing

Joining ICSpark

ICS 314

All of these things make me excited to code again. 

College is supposed to be hard because it makes you realize what is worth your time
