# Broadband for Hawai`i

Modern society has been increasingly reliant on technology for everyday tasks. Unfortunately, not everyone can access online services or are unfamiliar with connecting to and using the internet. Broadband for Hawaiʻi is an interactive accessible online platform that allows people to learn more about the internet and technology through classes and workshops. Users can register for classes, take quizzes, accumulate points and earn badges. Admins can create activities and view a dashboard showing a visualization of users’ data and survey results.

## The Problem

Broadband for Hawaiʻi is split into 3 main roles: General Public, User, and Admin. 
- The general public has access to some class components such as viewing sessions, events, and lessons that allows them to view the classes without logging in. They are also able to view more information through the list of resources on the site.
- The user role can register for classes and sessions, create a personal profile, and accumulate points. They are enabled to view lessons and then test their knowledge by taking quizzes that provide feedback when completed. Logged in users are motivated with a point system. They can gain points by taking quizzes and answering problems correctly.
- The admin role is in charge of creating classes, quizzes, and sessions. They provide all of the resources and information for these that the users can then access. Admins have access to data analytics collected from the user’s profile data and survey data.

## Learnings and Personal Responsibilities

An important part of collaborations is understanding each other's strengths and weaknesses. It was a process of mutual understanding, where identifying strengths and weaknesses became the cornerstone of our collective success. Another important lesson we learned was finding the balance between what needed to be implemented for our client and additional features we wanted to implement in order to make our project stand out. Understanding the requirements and translating them into technical specifications was a big contributor to our success as a team and our success in satisfying the client.

I focused on the front end. My reponsibilities include: the design of the classes and lessons page, the functionality of the lessons page, and implementing ADA compliant features to our images, icons, text, and videos. 

## Results

Our team placed 3rd overall in the Custom Coded Solution Division, as well as earning the People's Choice Award. For more information on this project, our devpost article is linked <a href="https://devpost.com/software/chipmunks">here</a>.
