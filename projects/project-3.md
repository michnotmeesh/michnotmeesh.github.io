Last semester I took HAW 201 and the final project was a wikiō (video) that was dubbed with Hawaiian. The requirements for the final project included rewriting and translating the script into Hawaiian, recording the script with your own voice to demonstrate accurate pronunciation, and editing the voiceover onto the video. We were given 2 weeks to complete the project and we must team up with another classmate. I chose to team up with a classmate who I got to know fairly well (as well as you can online) through Zoom.

My classmate and I were organized and created a timeline of deadlines and tasks. We split the task so that we would each contribute a little to translating, writing, and recording. I also have some experience with video editing, so I offered to edit the voiceover video if my partner was able to record the main character's voice. Unfortunatly, my partner caught COVID when we had to record and it became difficuult for her to continue all school work. I felt very bad for her and I informed the professor of our situation. In the end, we still needed to turn in a final project and I was perfectly capable of recording the script by myself. I sent her every recording and asked for her approval to make sure she was still included in the process of the final project. She essentially became the quality manager and I think that was a very important role.

This was a interesting experience because of COVID. I'm sure we've all done group projects by ourselves before and then reprimanded our groupp members in the peer evaluation. However, this was the first time "getting a good grade" was not my sole motivation for doing well. My partner caught COVID at work and she suspected some people were feeling sick. They did not take off of work becuase they would not be paid if they had COVID and weren't able to make their shifts. Hearing this news made me extremely upset at the irresponsible, yet sadly inevitable, decisions that her coworkers made. To me, this was a situation that could not be predicted and my partner did not deserve to fail this final. Even with COVID, my partner was resilient and conducted her role as quality manager very well. I strongly believe that safety and health always comes first.

Watch all the final nā wikiō from my class <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMfdsfvWaUI">here</a>. My groupʻs video starts at 10:20 and I hope you enjoy!
